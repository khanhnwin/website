## About the team

Flutter is Google's new cross-platform UI toolkit that lets designers and
developers craft beautiful, native apps for Android, iOS, desktop and web from a
single code base. Flutter is poised to change how people build apps, and we’ve
seen explosive growth over the last couple of years, leading us to continue to
expand our team. Flutter is one of Google's most significant open source
contributions, and is one of the top 10 software repos on GitHub. 

Flutter is a well-funded project, and is the magic sauce behind some of Google’s
most strategic products including Google Nest Hub, Google Pay, Stadia, Ads, and
Classroom. Externally, it’s used by nearly 400,000 apps from companies and
brands including WeChat, eBay, Alibaba, Sonos, SHEIN, ByteDance and PUBG. The
existing PM team is a diverse and high-performing group of individuals based
across our offices in Mountain View, Seattle, Denmark, as well as remotely.

## About the position

Help us to help Apple developers to fall in love with Flutter.

Lead Flutter product management for Apple platforms. In this role, you'll lead
our product development efforts towards Apple platforms, in particular iOS and
macOS. You'll be responsible for developing a vision and roadmap for all things
Apple-related, in particular:

- Using macOS as a development environment for building Flutter apps;
- Using Flutter to build high-quality, polished experiences for iOS, macOS and beyond.

You will be responsible for the end-to-end experience of Flutter on Apple
platforms: ensuring that developers have a highly-productive, friction-free
experience through the full lifecycle of an app; that Flutter apps are fully
worthy of "App of the Day" placement on the Apple App Store; and that startups
and design agencies choose Flutter so they can release a great experience on day
one for both iOS and Android.

This is a challenging, broad role that will provide a lot of internal and
external exposure.
