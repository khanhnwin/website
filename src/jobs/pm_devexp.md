## About the team

Flutter is Google's new cross-platform UI toolkit that lets designers and
developers craft beautiful, native apps for Android, iOS, desktop and web from a
single code base. Flutter is poised to change how people build apps, and we’ve
seen explosive growth over the last couple of years, leading us to continue to
expand our team. Flutter is one of Google's most significant open source
contributions, and is one of the top 10 software repos on GitHub. 

Flutter is a well-funded project, and is the magic sauce behind some of Google’s
most strategic products including Google Nest Hub, Google Pay, Stadia, Ads, and
Classroom. Externally, it’s used by nearly 400,000 apps from companies and
brands including WeChat, eBay, Alibaba, Sonos, SHEIN, ByteDance and PUBG. The
existing PM team is a diverse and high-performing group of individuals based
across our offices in Mountain View, Seattle, Denmark, as well as remotely.

## About the position

Join the Flutter product management team to oversee the core framework and
developer experience. You'll be responsible for the end-to-end developer journey
for Flutter apps, as well as the core framework itself, working with the
engineering team to design and build a product that fits the needs of mobile,
web and desktop developers. 

## Our values

### Mentorship

Upon joining Google, you will be paired with a formal mentor, who will help

systems you’ll need to do your job. Your manager can also help you find mentors

mentors, we work and train together so that we are always learning from one
another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team
members.

across their communities and Google.

### Work-Life balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance
between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and
success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work
